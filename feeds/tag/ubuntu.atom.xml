After all, the devices and the Internet that we connect to are not designed to be secure and to be privacy driven by default. That said, the end user is not aware, concerned and not knowledgeable about how to secure their digital environment. Therefore, with this product leadership role I would like to engage with technical, community and commercial audiences to find out what could be a turnkey solution for the end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is playing an important role in privacy and security. But open source is not the only element to take into consideration to facilitate contribution of the community. Contribution to the community is based on transparency. In my previous working experience when I was working for an open source company gave me insides how the open source community works. However in a meantime it demonstrated to me how privacy and security topics were left out due to meeting product milestones, and making the product out on market as soon as possible. In my opinion the biggest challenge is balancing transparency, security and privacy. In the early stage of product design and development we should involve a subject-matter expert (SME) and collaborate with the community to create a bridge between security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers and clients are relying on vendor risk management assessment by evaluating third-party cybersecurity posture. The assessment is aiming to ensure security across an organization's IT ecosystem. However, the multiplicity of tools generates struggles when it comes to implement and maintain security technical and organisational measures. Simplicity and transparency are great future investments to consolidate tools, fulfill and demonstrate compliance requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore digital transformation is underway finding itself accelerated. Enterprises are increasingly moving toward a hybrid cloud infrastructure. Because it is providing a seamless integration management with cloud datacenters, applications and workloads. Even with these improvements, challenges due to aggressive data growth remains. Following the same trend the application security has matured, together with DevSecOps. Nevertheless there is no single testing technique or an orchestration that has helped development, operation and security teams to mitigate all security risk. It requires teams to employ multiple tools and robust orchestration solutions from multiple vendors to secure simultaneously the SDLC and the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical is well positioned to succeed in solving the above issue with sandboxing and ensuring isolated data with the use of snaps. Another Livepatch Service is fixing and applying critical kernel patches automatically without restarting the system, and in the IoT devices Ubuntu Core provides a compliment setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data has three states: in transit, at rest and in use. In the current state of art data is often encrypted “at rest” in storage and “in transit” across the network thanks to cloud computing, but not while “in use” in memory. In this regard the ability to protect data and code application while it is in use in conventional computing infrastructure is even more important.The three states principle allows a robust and sustainable ecosystem for IoT, robotics, automotive and health industries, and etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the exponential growth of digital transformation, organizations underestimate their needs in security, resilience and agility. To secure and harden an organization, you have to take into account several factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;security and privacy by design,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;security and privacy by default,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;orchestration of controls,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encrypting data in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having this in mind the organizations will have a better way of managing the weakest link in technology, that is the human. Each organisation usually has enforced awareness training, phishing simulations, IT security guidance, process and practice - but is this enough? There will never be such a thing as perfect security, but rather it requires a data-driven and content-centric approach to understand the root cause and to develop the products security and privacy by design and by default. Last but not least, it is important to build a stable governance bridge between the consumer and the engineers to understand, and discuss what can be done to guarantee a secure, resilient product. Hence, the critical level of security issues that routinely plague IT today ought not be as big as they are today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pages"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="privacy"></category><category term="canonical"></category><category term="ubuntu"></category><category term="default"></category><category term="design"></category><category term="vision"></category></entry><entry><title>First time Lenovo, hopefully for sure the last time</title><link href="https://predragtasevski.com/posts/2013/10/first-time-lenovo-hopefully-for-sure-the-last-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-21T23:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-10-21T23:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Predrag TASEVSKI - Pece</name></author><id>tag:predragtasevski.com,2013-10-21:/posts/2013/10/first-time-lenovo-hopefully-for-sure-the-last-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have got the &lt;a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/edge-series/e330/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenovo Thinkpad Edge

E330&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
one year ago. It was my first time experience with Lenovo. Previous
experience was with HP, and in fact I’m sure that I do not want to get
into it, as well as even to remember it or even to mention it. Anyhow,
coming back to the Thinkpad, at the first I just fall in love with the
keyboard as well as with the red mouse pad, also the solid structure and
the black color. Like they always say laptop for the underground/hacking
and indeed nerd people, as me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, recent event or I might say events made me to write this
post, where usually I do not write this kind of content to share.
However, let me start from the begging to least event as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First event occurred after four months where suddenly after watching the
movie the left or the right speaker stopped working. I was not aware of
this occurrence so I have continue to use the laptop, for music and for
any thing of course. But after one or to week the laptop was mute. Just
one note that I was only using &lt;a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/"&gt;Ubuntu 12.04
LTS&lt;/a&gt;, Linux, so I thought that it
might happened while I was updating and upgrading the kernel and the
drivers. After one week of troubleshooting, with forums, ubuntu ask,
kernel FAQ, finally we came to conclusion in IRC channel of ubuntu that
this might be the hardware problem. So I took the laptop to the support
service where I actually both it. The support was very friendly and of
course they did understand my problem. They have even try in front of
me, but with no sound at all. Meanwhile, while I was there we also
spotted smudge on the corner of the display. Ok, perfect, I’m already
there so let us fix it two in one. Due to the missing parts of display
the support guy just manage to order only the speakers, and he told me
to give him a call in one month to order the display as well. Usually
Lenovo alloweds one part per month to be changed, nevertheless better
something than nothing. After the speakers fixing issue the engineer
told me that the plastic where the speakers where it was kind of malted.
Surprisingly, I did not know what to say, I was listening music and loud
as anyone else. Nevertheless, this problem was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one month I have called him to order display and in 7 days hi send
me an email to bring the laptop to change it. Perfect, lets do it!
Finally I have got the new display installed without any spots. So I
asked the guy how it did happened, was there kind of damage or something
else. His response was very clear during the assembling of the parts,
putting them in order they most probably scratch the display on the
back. Uhhh, this can happened, of course, but why to me. Either I just
have bad luck or I’m just not too good with technology. Last but not
least, some how after few months the spot appeared again, almost on the
same place. Uffffff…, not again…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final problem just happened today, while I was at school writing
homework and of course working on the research paper, the battery went
out. So I plug the laptop into the desk at school, but somehow does not
charge at all. Yes, so my charger is death or maybe the entire laptop
too. Just one note, before you start wandering how I did write this
post, simple it is on the blackberry tablet. Thank you blackberry for
such a great present. Coming back, as some of you currently know I’m
outside of where I purchased the laptop, so this adds plus effort to
find a support or service for Lenovo in France. Being honest, the entire
site of Lenovo is with really bed information, and also does not helps
you how you should proceed with this problem. First thing that came into
my mind is to check if I still have the warranty. After struggling of
typing the information through smart phone, I see that the warranty of
the laptop just expired one day ago. Nice, uhuuu, I’m so bloody lucky.
In the few days, I will just need to get use to the tablet, as well as
smart phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I just want to emphasis  why Lenovo will be my first and
of course my last laptop, or even any hardware from Lenovo, because of
the above occurrence. Also, like we usually say, the giant manufactures
are always producing products to expire after the warranty. So indeed,
Lenovo you are doing a hell of a good job. Hopefully if you continuous
in this path you will end of hell of a unsatisfied customers like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry Lenovo for writing such a bed words about your production, but
please put yourself into my shoes and position. I’m hell out
frustruated. Of course I’m sick of buying laptop every year.
Nevertheless, from know one I should start searching for right one, to
fall in love. If you have any suggestions please share them below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation of &lt;a href="http://tug.org/texworks/" title="Texworks"&gt;Texworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the shell command we install the texworks with the following script:&lt;/p&gt;

    Where we can see from the above output that the ```libpoppler-qt4.so.3 = not found ``` is missing.The best way to solve this issue, first we have to locate where are the other libraries of QT4. This is very simple approach, because the other libraries links, location is provided from the above output. Therefore, we can see that in the path ```/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/``` there is an library called: ```libpoppler-qt4.so.4```.# ResolutionFrom the above output, and the path that we have found of the missing library, there is an simple and easy way of fixing this issue, shown below.Therefore, in the terminal we can make an soft link with the missing library from the already existing one, with the following:```sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpoppler-qt4.so.4 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpoppler-qt4.so.3```And now the texworks works perfectly!# Details
