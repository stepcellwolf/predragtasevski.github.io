PURPOSE
=======

</p>

The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:

</p>

-   Where did we discovered the information (links or sources)
-   What kind of source of communication we used, for instance: instant
    messing, ICQ, IRC, which contact we have gather the information
-   What are the prices for the above attacks.

</p>

First of all, we must bear in mind that collecting the above information
it is presented to a numerous affected sources ( i.e. Website, news,
forums, IRC chat,etc.). By visiting the source can lead you to a virus,
trojan, malicious code, malware, etc. Which can damage your system.
Therefore, we are going to use virtual environment to find our demands.
In addition, we will use different languages and different search
engines.

</p>

Construction of report is separated by tasks section. Where each section
is presented with the source, communication type and the costs of the
service. In addition, in Appendix 1 we give the configuration of virtual
environment.

</p>

Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.

</p>

Following list is the numeration of the tasks:

</p>

TASK 3
------

</p>

Nowadays it is not hard to find an infected machine/computer. Because
most of the user PC’s are based with operating system Windows and are
most of them infected. I have try so hard to find infected machine
price, but until today, I did not come up with any good source.
Therefore, I would like if it is possible to add this source and discuss
this source and information with the fellow students.

</p>

TASK 4
------

</p>

Spamming for one million people it sounds impossible, but still out
there someone is offering this service. Here is from Kazakhstan source
with the following information, translated in English:

</p>

<div class="highlight">

</div>

</p>

Indeed, for 10 000 KZT = 67.45 USD and the amount of message send are 20
000 spam. Then the price for one million spam is 3.372.5 USD without
discount. The above links is from the following source [Rassilka.kz].

</p>

CONCLUSION
==========

</p>

I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
for any service that we looked for, it has a price. Value that are
different in other countries and currencies. Yet, before you start this
research make sure that you are not using your local machine.

</p>

Likewise, I have used an virtual environment to be able to collect all
the above data. Because the sites, forums, links, etc. are infected with
malicious code, or can be easily traceable.

</p>

In summary, we utter gather as much as possible different sources and
different prices. Most expensive is the spam for one million people,
second is DDoS attacks and never the last is to gain an credit card
numbers from different countries and different price.

</p>

For more info please refer to following source [QuinStreet Inc] why I
have chose Russia as the main source.
