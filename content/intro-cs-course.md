[YES Incubator](http://yes.org.mk) in collaboration with
[CyberSecurity.mk](http://cybersecurity.mk) have organized one-day
introduction course of cyber security, on 09 of February 2013. Whereby
the participants have learned and have been introduced to the
terminology, possible most common attacks, vulnerabilities, as well as
exploitation of IT systems. In addition, we had a work-shop with
beforehand prepared scenarios.

</p>

The agenda of the course was as below:

- Cyber security vs. IT security

- Types of attacks

- Types of vulnerabilities

- Types of exploitation

- Work-shop: Red, White and Blue teams

</p>

The attendance to the course was 20 people, which in fact surprises me
in a very good way. The group was with various of majors, for instance
from the youngest elementary school, students in engineering to IT
specialises in financial sector, as well as future start-ups
e-commerce/e-shops companies.

</p>

Turning to a near future we will prepare a courses with more in-depth
work-shops and more technical. Likewise, getting hands dirty, by
hacking, attacking virtual machines, as well as performing
countermeasures. Throughout virtualiazed environment attacks and
exploitations, etc.

</p>

Hopefully that the above course has raised the awareness level of IT
security importance.

To have a better picture and understanding what we have covered on the
training we have provided you with the presentation below and picture
